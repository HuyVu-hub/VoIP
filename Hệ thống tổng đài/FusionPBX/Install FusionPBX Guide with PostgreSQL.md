# <a name="1">Note</a>

- The following must be installed first: 
    Web Server - NGINX
    
=>  The default is NGINX as its small fast and easy to configure HTTPs is pre-configured with a self signed certificate.


- Database Server - PostgreSQL or SQLite
PostgreSQL is an advanced ANSI SQL compliant database. It is stable and powerful. It has native UUID data types, native JSON support, Foreign Data Wrappers, multi-master replication and a lot more. Multi-master file and database replication are taught in the FusionPBX Advanced training. SQLite is a great choice for embedded systems. SQLite should not be used for the FusionPBX database for multi-tenant systems.
